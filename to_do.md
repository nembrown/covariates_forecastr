#### Covariates to add
- zooplankton offshore and up to current
- Argo floating temperature
- Temperature, salinity, and zooplankton data that can cover American stocks
- ALPI up to current

#### Efficiencies
- for loops for plotting
- 2022 to system year
- 2021 cut off to just read in the NAs and then filter out if not complete

#### Nomenclature
- cov to Cov in output
- Lag change to + 1, lead to -1

#### Further development
- shiny_formatting expand and tag on to scripts for each stock 
- develop shiny alternative, taking covariates and running forecastR in R

#### Relocation
- move script to CTC gitlab
- move excel output to CTC sharepoint
